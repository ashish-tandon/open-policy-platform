## 🚨 Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### If deployment fails:
```bash
# Clean up and retry
./scripts/setup-mcp-complete-40by6.sh --clean
./scripts/deploy-complete-mcp-stack-40by6.sh
```

### If services won't start:
```bash
# Check logs
docker compose -f backend/docker-compose.yml logs

# Restart services
docker compose -f backend/docker-compose.yml restart
```

### If ports are blocked:
```bash
# Check what's using the ports
lsof -i :8000
lsof -i :5173
lsof -i :5432
```

## 🌐 Access Points

Once running, access your MCP stack at:

- **API Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health
- **Admin Panel**: http://localhost:5173/admin
- **Scraper Dashboard**: http://localhost:5173/scrapers

## 📱 Mobile App

The mobile app components are ready in `mobile/App.tsx` and can be built with:
```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npm run build
```

## 🔍 Monitoring & Health
