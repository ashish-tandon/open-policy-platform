# ü§ñ AI Agent Guidance System - OpenPolicy Merge

## üéØ **MISSION CONTROL: KEEPING AI AGENTS ON TRACK**

This document serves as the **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** for all AI agents working on the OpenPolicy Merge project. It ensures consistency, prevents confusion, and maintains development focus.

---

## üìã **CORE PRINCIPLES**

### **1. PLAN BEFORE EXECUTE**
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** review the comprehensive development plan before making changes
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** check test coverage requirements before implementing features
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** validate against acceptance criteria before proceeding
- ‚úÖ **NEVER** skip planning phase or rush to implementation

### **2. TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT**
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** write tests before implementing features
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** ensure 100% test coverage for all components
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** verify tests pass before committing code
- ‚úÖ **NEVER** implement features without corresponding tests

### **3. DOCUMENTATION FIRST**
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** update documentation when making changes
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** maintain clear commit messages
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** track progress in development logs
- ‚úÖ **NEVER** make undocumented changes

### **4. CHECK BEFORE CREATE - CRITICAL RULE**
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** search the entire codebase before creating ANY new file, script, or functionality
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** verify that similar functionality doesn't already exist in any repository
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** check for existing test plans, frameworks, or scripts before creating new ones
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** adapt and improve existing code rather than creating duplicates
- ‚úÖ **NEVER** create new functionality without first confirming it doesn't exist
- ‚úÖ **NEVER** duplicate testing frameworks, plans, or scripts that already exist
- ‚úÖ **NEVER** assume something needs to be created without thorough codebase search

### **5. TERMINAL COMMAND SAFEGUARDS - CRITICAL RULE**
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** use `is_background: false` for terminal commands unless specifically needed
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** return to user immediately after completing terminal tasks
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** avoid getting stuck in long-running terminal commands
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** provide clear status updates after each command
- ‚úÖ **NEVER** wait for user input in terminal commands
- ‚úÖ **NEVER** get stuck in interactive terminal sessions
- ‚úÖ **NEVER** leave terminal commands hanging or waiting
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** come back to user after "Mission Accomplished" or completion messages
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** proceed to next step immediately after task completion
- ‚úÖ **NEVER** assume user wants to wait for additional terminal output

## üö® **CRITICAL SAFEGUARDS**

### **TERMINAL COMMAND PROTOCOL**
```bash
# 1. Before running any terminal command
- [ ] Set is_background: false (unless specifically needed)
- [ ] Ensure command has clear completion criteria
- [ ] Plan next step after command completion

# 2. During terminal command execution
- [ ] Monitor for completion or timeout
- [ ] Avoid interactive prompts or waiting
- [ ] Return to user immediately after completion

# 3. After terminal command completion
- [ ] Provide clear status update
- [ ] Proceed to next step immediately
- [ ] Come back to user with results
- [ ] Never wait for additional input unless specifically requested
```

### **COMPLETION PROTOCOL**
```bash
# 1. When task is complete
- [ ] Provide clear "Mission Accomplished" or completion message
- [ ] Return to user immediately
- [ ] Proceed to next step without waiting
- [ ] Never get stuck in terminal or waiting states

# 2. When deployment is complete
- [ ] Show final status and metrics
- [ ] Return to user immediately
- [ ] Provide next steps or recommendations
- [ ] Never wait for additional confirmation unless specifically requested
```

## üîç **MANDATORY CODEBASE SEARCH PROTOCOL**

### **BEFORE CREATING ANYTHING NEW:**
```bash
# 1. Search for existing functionality
- [ ] Use semantic search for similar functionality
- [ ] Search for existing test files and frameworks
- [ ] Check for existing plans and documentation
- [ ] Look for similar scripts or tools

# 2. Verify uniqueness
- [ ] Confirm no duplicate functionality exists
- [ ] Check if existing code can be adapted
- [ ] Verify if existing code needs improvement instead
- [ ] Ensure we're not recreating existing work

# 3. Document findings
- [ ] List all existing similar functionality found
- [ ] Explain why new creation is necessary (if any)
- [ ] Document how existing code will be adapted/improved
- [ ] Update this guidance system with findings
```
