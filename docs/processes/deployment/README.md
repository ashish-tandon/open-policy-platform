else
    echo "❌ Web interface unhealthy"
    exit 1
fi

# Check database
echo "Checking database..."
if curl -f http://api-service:8000/health/database > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "✅ Database healthy"
else
    echo "❌ Database unhealthy"
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ All health checks passed"
```

### **4.2 Functionality Validation**
